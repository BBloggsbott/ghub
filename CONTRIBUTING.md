# Contributing to GHub

If you are interested in contributing to GHub, take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/BBloggsbott/ghub/issues) page and comment on an issue you are interested in working on. You can also contribute to an issue that has been assigned to someone. Once you are assigned to an issue, for the [repo](https://github.com/BBloggsbott/ghub). Create a branch with a meaningful name and [reference the issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests) in the first commit to the branch. Submit a PR when you feel you have made enough progress. Make sure you write tests for all the modules you create.

Pull requests that solve the same issue will be merged on a First come first serve basis.
